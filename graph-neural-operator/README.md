# Graph-PDE
This repository contains the code for the paper:
[Neural Operator: Graph Kernel Network for Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03485)

You will want to make sure you have PyTorch and torch-geometric installed as well as torch-scatter, torch-cluster, and torch-[something] (I can't remember the last thing)

If you have access to CUDA, change all of the places you see "cpu" to "cuda" for a speedup in computation.
